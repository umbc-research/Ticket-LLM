Key Options
Default umask on chip
The default umask setting on the cluster is 00071111. This ensures that by default, new files and directories are accessible to you and your group, but restricted from all other users.
For more information on how umask works, see resources like the 
umask Page
.
Default Permission Structure
Permissions on chip are pre-configured based on the type of 
Persistent Storage
 being used.
 
Directory Type
Path Template
Octal Permission
Description
Home Directory
/home/$USER
700
Full access for owner; no access for group/others.
 
Research: Common
/umbc/rs/$GROUP/common
770
Full access for owner and group; no access for others.
 
Research: User
/umbc/rs/$GROUP/users/$USER
750
Full access for owner; read/execute for group; no access for others.
 
File Tree and Permissions Overview
The following tree illustrates how permissions are typically distributed across your available storage volumes:
/ (root)

├── home/

│   └── $USER/ [700: rwx------]  <-- Private user environment

└── umbc/rs/

    └── $GROUP/

        ├── common/ [770: rwxrwx---] <-- Shared group collaboration

        └── users/

            └── $USER/ [750: rwxr-x---] <-- Personal research storage
The Group Special Bit (setgid)
In shared environments like the 
Research Common
 directory, the "group special bit" (also known as 
setgid
) is often utilized.
Purpose
: When the setgid bit is applied to a directory, any new files or subdirectories created within it automatically inherit the 
Group ID
 of the parent directory rather than the primary group of the user who created the file.
Why it matters on chip
: This is critical for the 
/common
 research volumes to ensure that all members of a PI’s research group can continue to access and collaborate on shared data, regardless of which specific user uploads or creates a file.
Identification
: In a long directory listing (
ls -l
), this is represented by an 
's'
 in the group execute position (e.g., 
drwxrws---
).
Modifying Existing Permissions
To change permissions for existing files or directories, use the 
chmod
 (change mode) command.
Generic Syntax:
chmod [options] [mode] [File_name]
 
 
Common Modes
You can specify modes using either 
Symbolic
 (letters) or 
Octal
 (numbers) notation.
Symbolic Examples
:
chmod u+rwx [file]
 – Grants read, write, and execute to the owner.
chmod go-w [file]
 – Removes write permissions for the group and others.
 
Octal Examples
:
chmod 770 [directory]
 – Sets 
rwxrwx---
 (Owner/Group full access).
chmod 644 [file]
 – Sets 
rw-r--r--
 (Owner read/write, others read-only).
Key Options
-R
 (Recursive)
: Applies the change to all files and subdirectories within a directory.
-v
 (Verbose)
: Displays a message for every file processed.
For a full list of available flags and symbolic operators, refer to the 
standard Linux chmod documentation
.
