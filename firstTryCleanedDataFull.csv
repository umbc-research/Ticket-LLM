To summarize, it appears that Nikki Monczewski from the iHARPNSF HDR Institute is reaching out to Roy Prouty and Max Breitmeyer from the DOIT Unix Infra team regarding an issue with a server located in room 140 of the 900 Walker Avenue building.  Nikki mentions that the server is making noise, causing disruptions, and has been a concern for some time. She asks if it's possible to relocate the server or find an alternative solution.  Roy Prouty responds, suggesting that Nikki reach out to the facilities department to report the issue, as they may be able to provide a more suitable environment for the server.  Max Breitmeyer also responds, mentioning that he is not aware of any servers in room 140 and asks if Nikki can provide more information about the server in question."

You can do this using srun, sbatch, or an interactive job. Here are the basics for requesting resources via slurm on Ada. Hopefully this helps. https://hpcf.[DOMAIN]/ada/slurm/overview/. I couldn't find the link on the HPCF website that describes the procedure of running git operations in a slurm allocation. Could you refer me to that link? That seems very likely if you're attempting to run github copilot locally on the login node and not as an API. Running these git operations is not necessarily a problem, it's running them on the login node. As was suggested in the email, run these operations in a slurm allocation as defined on the ada website, and it shouldn't be a problem. I turned them off a while ago AFAIR and again I turned them off today after receiving the email from [STAFF]. FYI, I was using GitHub Copilot and I uninstalled that too. Is it related to that?

Currently, the user [USER] has 1000 array jobs submitted, with 13 running and the rest pending. Jobs are pending primarily due to priority settings in Slurm, as [USER] has been deprioritized based on resource usage. While Ada is a shared resource, the priority setup ensures fair access for all users. Once the running jobs complete, other users' jobs will likely move to the front of the queue. Notably, job age in the queue also affects priority—the longer a job waits, the higher its chance of running next. I recommend submitting your jobs even if resources aren’t immediately available, as they will be prioritized once current jobs finish. You can learn more about priority on our page https://hpcf.umbc.edu/ada/slurm/priority/. On [DATE], [STAFF] wrote: System: ada Request Type: General Support I tried to run some jobs but couldn’t get anything through because the user `[USER]` has run a 1000-array job which has the entire cluster tied up. Requesting 1000 GPUs is extremely unprofessional. On top of that, all the gnodes are being used by the job.

Remember that jobs should never be expected to immediately run on a shared resource. Jobs that don't immediately run are then in a 'pending' or 'PD' state. Slurm determines which job from the set of PD jobs should run next based on three factors: 1) How long the PD jobs has been waiting to run 2) How frequently the user's group has been running jobs 3) How large the job is (smaller jobs have slightly more priority). Item 1) means that any job you desire to run should be submitted ASAP and left for slurm to run when slurm can identify the resources. Item 2) means that users who have been 'hogging' the cluster quickly see their jobs de-prioritized in favor of users who have submitted jobs but not used the cluster as much. Item 3) doesn't factor much into the issue I believe you're communicating, but exists nonetheless. Further, no job can run on requested resources for more than 72 hours. This is due to preemption rules that exist on the cluster, but this preemption don't seem to have been at play given the timeframe of this ticket.

"3102116","66993198","2025-01-17 14:49:26","taki - Sparse Network Simulation Question","Hi [USER], From what I can find there is no way to force slurm to run all at the same time, but there are a few workarounds we can try. First, you can specify nodes which are in the 'idle' (meaning no resources are being used) state using the '--nodelist' flag. Note that using this flag will make it so that your jobs will only run on the specified node list so make sure you do the math on the resources requested. Second, you can use '--hold' flag in the command to put all your jobs into a pending state until the resources are available. You'll then have to manually release the job using 'scontrol release $job_number' once you see the available nodes. As an aside, one of the nice things about using sbatch is that you can put all of the flags/options in the slurm file that you are submitting as an sbatch, and not have to rewrite it every time you want to resubmit the job. For example in your slurm file here you could write: '#!/bin/bash #SBATCH --time=30 #SBATCH --qos=normal+ #SBATCH --account=[STAFF] #SBATCH --partition=cpu_2021 #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 #SBATCH --array=0-5 #SBATCH --hold' Finally, note that there is no partition called 'batch' anymore (they were shutdown as of august 2023). The names of the partitions can be found here https://hpcf.umbc.edu/system-description-taki/. Hope this helps, and let me know if you need further assistance. I want to start doing some experiments again for my side project that involve simulating sparse networks on Taki. The last time I did one of these experiments, which has been months at this point, I used a Slurm command along the lines of this: sbatch --time=30 --qos=normal+ --account=[STAFF] --partition=batch -c 1 --array=0-199 `pwd`/ddlserver.slurm $modelfolder 200 buildnetwork $seed. The issue with this command was that, depending on the load on the cluster, some fraction of the intended 200 jobs used to simulate the 200 node network would be launched, but they would timeout before the rest of the 200 jobs were launched. In order for the code to run correctly, all 200 jobs need to be running at the same time. Is there a way to let Slurm know that all the jobs need to be launched at the same time and that they should be held until that is possible? Is there also some way to let Slurm know that the jobs primarily spend their time sleeping while they wait for other nodes on the network to finish processing their data? The last time I worked on this project, I did try to look through the Slurm documentation to look for flags and environment variables that could help the simulations run more smoothly, but I never was able to find anything that worked the way I wanted it to. Please let me know if you have any ideas for the best way for me to proceed."

In this case, the user '[USER]' is a member of the pi_ryus PI group out of CSEE. Importantly, the user `[USER]` is running single GPU card jobs on the RTX 6000 nodes. The job you've highlighted (job ID 405825) is required to run on eight RTX 8000 machines. The RTX 8000 machines are being used by another three users running another ten jobs. As I write this, g03 with 8x 2080Ti GPU cards is free. The other job submitted by a user in your group (job ID 405901) is required to run on RTX 6000 GPU cards and is slated to start in the next day or so, but may run sooner if the jobs run by user '[USER]' end ahead of their 72 hour preemption timelimit. On usage in general: Jobs that don't immediately run post-submission are put in a 'pending' or 'PD' state. Slurm determines which job from the set of PD jobs should run next based on a few factors: 1) How long the PD job has been waiting to run, 2) How frequently the user's group has been running jobs, 3) How large the job is (smaller jobs have slightly more priority). Item 1 means that any job you desire to run should be submitted ASAP and left for slurm to run when slurm can identify the resources. Item 2 means that users who have been 'hogging' the cluster quickly see their jobs de-prioritized in favor of users who have submitted jobs but not used the cluster as much. All of that said, while the usage of the cluster due to user '[USER]' is high, I can see already that jobs submitted by this user are being de-prioritized in favor of others. Slurm takes this into consideration when resources become free. A separate faculty slurm doesn't seem to be factoring into its estimated start time is the preemption policy on ada that limits jobs to no more than three days of runtime if the hardware is requested by another job. I am in no way suggesting this usage us ideal, but just that (1) the output of squeue can make it seem like the user is using more than they actually are and (2) the user is not yet running afoul of any usage rules. These usage rules were discussed and set by the PIs of the original NSF MRI that funded ada back in 2020. In the near future, faculty-led governance groups will be established and these rules stand to be revisited.

Additionally, as a class of neutron star, they are among the most dense objects known aside from black holes. These qualities make magnetars unique laboratories for studies of both intense magnetism and gravitation. Every new source discovered provides an important insight into these incredible stars, and given that there are only 24 confirmed magnetars despite population modeling suggesting many thousands in the Galaxy, searches for new sources are crucial for building a sufficient dataset for study. All of the known sources have been discovered serendipitously by wide-field instruments when the star undergoes an energetic but uncommon outburst; however, recent studies have begun to uncover a subpopulation of magnetars with much longer rotational periods (~100s of seconds rather than 1-12 s). As a part of a related study by the PI, we expect there to be many slower magnetars in the publicly-available XMM-Newton dataset that should be well over the instrument's sensitivity limit. For these reasons, we intend to search these data for slow period sources using our previously designed search pipeline. People: Alexander McEwen, George Younes Comments: The code has already been written to utilize the Slurm scheduling system, and is composed of many single tasks run as an array. In total, there are approximately 1500 XMM observations that will be included in the search. Individual job processing times can vary due to observation duration, but typically complete within a few minutes and up to an hour. In total, previous processing of a similar search with the same code completed in a few days time on a comparable HPC. Memory requirements are not significant, and a single GB per task is sufficient. Disk space requirements may be the most significant, as each of the observations may require one to several GB, and files generated in the processing may also take up to a GB. However, the pipeline removes the observation files after each task, and so this space will not be consumed all at once. -- [STAFF] Appointment Calendar: https://calendar.app.google/iorJbqg6p7N5oPbD9 royprouty.info"

Remember that jobs should never be expected to immediately run on a shared resource. Jobs that don't immediately run are then in a 'pending' or 'PD' state. Slurm determines which job from the set of PD jobs should run next based on three factors: 1) How long the PD jobs has been waiting to run, 2) How frequently the user's group has been running jobs, and 3) How large the job is (smaller jobs have slightly more priority). Item 1 means that any job you desire to run should be submitted ASAP and left for slurm to run when slurm can identify the resources. Item 2 means that users who have been 'hogging' the cluster quickly see their jobs de-prioritized in favor of users who have submitted jobs but not used the cluster as much. As I write this [STAFF] is unable to run additional jobs due to this deprioritization and jobs submitted by [USER] are slated next to run (see the output below). Item 3 doesn't factor much into the issue I believe you're communicating, but exists nonetheless. Further, no job can run on requested resources for more than 72 hours. This is due to preemption rules that exist on the cluster, but this preemption don't seem to have been at play given the timeframe of this ticket. I am not suggesting that this usage pattern is ideal, only that the user is operating within the rules set out by the PIs of the original NSF MRI that funded ada (along with DoIT). In the near future, faculty-led governance groups will be established and these rules may be revisited. I'm happy to take note of your concern and bring it up to these groups.

It can be loaded with the command 'module load abinit/10.0.7'. Note that you originally requested abinit 10.0.5. Attempting to download this from the source simply returns 10.0.7 version, so hopefully this is ok. I also ran the tests that are provided with abinit and all of them ran cleanly with the exception of the 'wannier90' test. This failed because the library is not currently present on the system, and I wanted to get this out to you as soon as possible. That being said, if you find it is necessary to your work, let me know and I will be happy to work with you. I'll leave this open a few days to see if you all have any issues with it. If so, let me know and we can hopefully work through it together. Otherwise, I'll close it! Thanks again for your patience!

Abstract:                  Radiance observations from NASA’s AIRS instrument provide an information rich, multi-decade record of climate change and variability. Directly comparing these observations with earth system models, however, is made difficult by definitional differences with model output and the absence of gridded, level-3 radiance datasets. I will create a level-3 dataset of AIRS radiances and compare these data with AIRS-like radiances produced by a satellite simulator tool running in an earth system model.

I have looked through the virtual environments you have been using and attempted to replicate the error and was unable to. What steps did you perform to install ollama inside the conda virtual environment? I was able to properly install ollama inside a new conda virtual environment by performing the following steps. First, I used the command 'conda create --name=*venv-name*' to create a conda virtual environment, then I activated that with 'conda activate *venv-name*'. After this, I was able to install ollama with 'pip install ollama'. This allowed me to run ollama commands without receiving the 'command not found' error. In addition, unless there is a specific use case that requires ollama to be run within python, you should be able to use the available module on ada to access ollama. The version built and available on ada is ollama/0.3.14 and can be accessed by using 'module load ollama/0.3.14'."

The SSH key would take the place of your password but you would still need to 2-factor during login. The only way to bypass the 2-factor is to connect via the [NETWORK] VPN. This is the case because the VPN already enforces 2-factor. You would then only have to 2-factor during the initial VPN connection and could subsequently use ssh to [SERVER] with the SSH key as long as the VPN session remains active. The underlying security requirement is the 2-factor step must be in the authentication path. Unfortunately the Linux authentication stack does not retain any information on prior successes or failures so each time you must satisfy all steps in the stack, even if you start 2 nearly simultaneous sessions both would have independent authentication paths."

Once you provide the commands you were attempting to run, I can know for sure. But, if you were attempting to install a pip package with conda install or pip install, depending on the size of the packages, there can be issues installing things. https://hpcf.umbc.edu/ada/software/python-environments-with-venv/ If you take a look at this link, under the pip section you can see that pip works by downloading the necessary package files in /tmp, and then removing them after install completes. However, if you are attempting to install a large package, the /tmp directory can get filled and result in error. You can manually specify the /tmp directory to a directory on the mounted manas storage with this command: TMPDIR='/nfs/ada/<group>/users/<username>' pip install <package-name> I hope this helps!

Despite advances in targeted therapies and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), resistance to these treatments is a common occurrence, underscoring the need for novel research approaches. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that integrates complex molecular data for the stratification of NSCLC patients. The proposed AI framework will enable personalized therapeutic strategies, overcoming the limitations of current precision oncology approaches. By translating knowledge from literature, functional genomics, and multi-omic patient-specific data, the framework will provide a comprehensive molecular understanding of NSCLC.
