"3293526","72398003","2025-10-21 16:00:08","HPC Slurm/Software Issue: Conda environment","This appears to be an email thread or a support ticket conversation between a user (Matthew Baker) and the Research Computing team at UMBC. The issue is related to a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment, specifically with the Conda environment not being applied consistently across all nodes.  Here's a summary of the issue:  * The user has allocated resources using `srun` and loaded the computation environment using `module load` and `conda activate`. * However, when testing the environment with `mpirun python -c 'import fiona; print(fiona.__version__)'`, only one node can use the Fiona library, while the others return a `ModuleNotFoundError`. * Further testing reveals that only one node uses the Conda environment's Python interpreter, while the others default to the system Python.  The Research Computing team responds with questions and potential solutions:  * Max Breitmeyer asks if the user has tried loading the GRASS module before activating the Conda environment. * He also suggests checking the `module list` output to ensure that the Conda environment is being loaded correctly. * Additionally, he mentions that there might be an issue with how the environment is initialized across nodes in the current cluster setup.  The conversation is ongoing, and the user has not yet provided a response or resolution."

Among all fMRI data analysis strategies, data-driven-based methods have a unique advantage of capturing the whole picture of available information since they effectively minimize assumptions imposed on the brain activity. With the increasing number of multimodal data and multisite data, the problem of balancing the computation cost and analysis performance is becoming more important than ever before. In this project, our interest is in identifying the most informative multivariate features when analyzing multiple fMRI datasets. Our goal is the development of flexible new decomposition methods as well as identifying the best feature extraction strategy for a given problem."

Lab Project Title: Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction Project Abstract: This project, Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction Using Historical Prices, News, and Sentiment, aims to predict short-term stock movements up, down, or stable by integrating numerical and textual financial data. The approach combines historical stock price features with sentiment analysis of financial news to capture both market trends and investor sentiment. Historical price data are collected from Yahoo Finance, while relevant news articles and headlines are sourced from the News API or GDELT. Sentiment scores are derived using FinBERT, a transformer-based model optimized for financial text, and aggregated on a daily basis. These sentiment features are then merged with technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and multi-day returns. The resulting multimodal dataset is labeled according to future price direction and used to train classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices to compare the predictive power of price-only, sentiment-only, and combined feature sets. The study explores both early and late fusion approaches to integrate modalities and applies feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP) to interpret model behavior. The findings aim to demonstrate how combining quantitative and qualitative signals can improve stock trend forecasting and provide insights into the interplay between market sentiment and price dynamics.

Yet current computer-vision tools often miss the subtle, ethologically relevant kinematic motifs that report changes in internal state. In this project, we will build a neuroscience-focused computational pipeline that couples the broad foundation model with the efficient and specialized detector to identify the animal behavior responded to sensory signal inputs. Specifically, we will distill knowledge from Vision Transformers into customized single-state Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pretrain these networks on a large, unlabeled corpus of murine behavioral videos spanning diverse common behavior experimental assays. The resulting models will be fine-tuned for high-throughput quantification of classified behavior phenotypes/signatures that serve as proxies for cognitive and affective states. This pipeline will enable experimenters to (i) stratify behavior with ethological precision, (ii) align these phenotypes with neural activities or perturbations by endogenous and environmental factors, and (iii) standardize assays across labs for reproducible neuroscience. Training and optimization demand large-scale data parallelism and extensive hyperparameter searches; thus, access to the UMBC HPC cluster is indispensable. This work will yield a biologically grounded, scalable toolset for objective behavior measurement in animal models, such as mice. The PI of this project is [STAFF], a Professor at Department of Biological Sciences ([EMAIL]). We would like to setup a new group to use HPC and data storage space. Our project members include UMBC students who are familiar with script coding. The project title and the abstract are included in this request."

"3304703","72621395","2025-10-31 14:44:35","HPC Other Issue: Request for sample SLURM job script to run WRF on CHIP","Hi [USER], First off, I wanted to clarify a couple points. 1. 'I was advised that running ./wrf.exe interactively is not permitted': This is untrue. You are able to run interactive jobs, where you create a slurm allocation on a node, then connect to it and run your code directly. You are not permitted to run jobs on the login node, which I believe is what you are thinking of. If you would like some documentation on how to run an interactive job, I'll include a link to a page with the commands required to do that. How to run interactive job: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CYCbQw 2. There is also a WRF module available to be loaded on chip. You can load WRF with: 'module load WRF/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar'. WPS is also available, and can be loaded with: 'module load WPS/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar'. These installations should work, however it is a slightly older version (4.4), whereas you compiled a newer one (4.5). 3. For your locally installed and compiled copy of WRF, if you desire to use it you must use the compiled binaries located under /umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/[USER]/model2/sources/WRF/main. This is where the actual WRF binaries are stored, the directory you provided was a test directory for testing the software. You will want to add this location to your PATH environment variable to utilize the binaries. It is also possible, depending on how your install was compiled, that it would need to be recompiled for MPI support. For more info, check out the Building WRF section of this page: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php We do not have any existing documentation on running WRF/WPS explicitly, however we have documentation on running MPI jobs, including some example SBATCH scripts: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCKV There is documentation on WRF's website for running WRF using mpi, take a look here: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/running_wrf.html If you have any additional questions or need clarification, please feel free to let me know.
