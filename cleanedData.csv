Note A full record of your request can be found at Ticket  Thank You _________________________________________ R e s o l u t i o n Hi [USER] First off let me elaborate on the slurm job ID's you are seeing. When submitting an array job there is the main job ID which is 402067 in this case along with the array tasks for each which are like 402067_90. However each individual array task also gets its own actual job ID. For example the actual job ID for array task 402067_90 is 402157. Next your job was likely canceled due to someone in pi_bennettj attempting to run a job on their nodes. Nodes c24-[01-10] are all nodes contributed from pi_bennettj therefore they have priority access and the ability to preempt other users not in their group. If you want to run your jobs on 2024 nodes but do not want to risk preemption use the 'match' partition. If you would like more information on which partitions allow/disallow preemption check out this wiki page https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1249509377/chip+Partitions+and+Usage#Partitions Let me know if that helps Have a nice day Kind regards [STAFF] DoIT Unix Infra Student Worker On Thu Sep 25 16:56:36 2025 [USER] wrote First Name [USER] Last Name [USER] Email [EMAIL] Campus ID [USER] Request Type High Performance Cluster For some reason many of my jobs are getting killed/preempted slurmsteps.

I wanted to suggest trying to add --mpi=pmix to srun commands (srun --mpi=pmix -n 8 /path/to/your/test --verbose). I think srun might be defaulting to a single rank, which could explain why you're seeing the 'Insufficient processes' error even when requesting multiple tasks and srun working when task is set to 1. pmix (Process Management Interface for Exascale) is the plugin that enables Slurm to correctly launch and manage MPI tasks across multiple ranks. Without specifying it, srun may not properly initialize the MPI environment. Let me know if that doesn't resolve the issue.

"3282188","2025-11-04 16:49:54","HPC Slurm/Software Issue: Please install newer Matlab","The text appears to be a email conversation between Matthias Gobbert, a professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and Max Breitmeyer, the High-Performance Computing (HPC) System Administrator at UMBC's Department of Information Technology (DOIT).  The conversation is about installing MATLAB R2025b on the HPC system. Matthias initially requests that Max install the latest version of MATLAB, R2025b, which had recently been released. Max responds by saying that he has added MATLAB 2025b to some partitions and is working on getting it installed on others.  Matthias then reports an issue with running jobs on the HPC system using MATLAB 2025b, providing error messages from the slurm output files. Max investigates the issue and determines that the problem is due to a license issue. He explains that there are two types of licenses for MATLAB: one for individual use and another for shared use on the HPC system.  Max informs Matthias that he has updated the license for the HPC system, and MATLAB 2025b should now be available on all partitions. The conversation ends with Max asking Matthias to try running his jobs again and report any further issues.  There is no specific 'question' being asked in this conversation, but rather a request for assistance with installing software on an HPC system and troubleshooting an issue that arose during the process."

"3283767","2025-10-07 16:00:19","HPC Slurm/Software Issue: Deleting .julia directories","Hi [USER], The solution is still to run chmod -R u+wrx DataFrames before attempting to remove the directory. The process is hanging because there are many files and directories to modify, which takes time. While the command is running, if your session is idle for too long, you may get logged out before it completes. To avoid this, I recommend using a tmux session to run the command so it can finish without interruption. You can learn more about tmux here (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/tmux-in-linux/). Once the permissions have been updated, you can remove the directory. I have already removed the /umbc/rs/pi_[STAFF]/users/[USER]/.julia/packages/DataFrames directory for you after changing the permissions. Please reply to the ticket if you still have questions.

We thought we resolved it, and it is kind of resolved, but I still have an issue deleting what I think are essentially corrupted directories. So, I have been dealing with issues downloading packages in Julia on the cluster, and I narrowed down the issue to the specific package 'DataFrames', which is actually quite a simple package, all it does is allows you to read CSV and other text files. The workaround that I have to do is that I just wrote my code in such a way that does not require the usage of DataFrames which is fine, but I still have a few directories in my research storage that house DataFrames package that I need to be deleted. Specifically, under /umbc/rs/pi_[STAFF]/users/[USER] I have 2 directories, '.julia' and '.julia_new' both of which need to be deleted as they house the package DataFrame which prevents me from really running anything. I also have the directory '.julia_test' which I am currently using and does work, so it shouldn't be deleted. I also have another .julia directory under /umbc/rs/pi_[STAFF]/common that needs to be deleted as well. I have tried running 'rm -rf .julia' for hours on end and it hangs. Even going into the directory itself, following the path, '/umbc/rs/pi_[STAFF]/users/[USER]/.julia/packages' and then doing 'rm -rf DataFrames' will hang as well. What ended up working on Friday, which was doing 'chmod -R u+wrx DataFrames' hangs as well now too. I have narrowed the issue all the way down to a specific file in DataFrames, it would be in the path '/umbc/rs/pi_[STAFF]/users/[USER]/.julia/packages/DataFrames/C5AEe/src' which is the source code for this specific package. The file in 'subdataframe' in the source directory is always the issue, which is weird because looking on github, the subdataframe.jl file, with which this is located, looks perfectly fine to me. Regardless, I would still like there to be a way to delete these excess directories in my research storage. Thanks."

Unless your group has contributed the H100 nodes, access to the node is shared between all of the cluster's users. Normally, your job would run after their job has completed. I suggest waiting until the currently running jobs complete, then your job will run. Or, if your job does not actually require two H100s, you could try to run it on other GPU hardware, such as L40S's or RTX_8000s. There is a greater amount of these nodes available, which would reduce the time it takes for your job to run. Let me know if you have any additional questions. Have a nice day!

After you compile the software, it is installed to whichever directory of your choosing. From there, all you need to do is add the path to your install directory to your PATH environment variable (or just run the binaries from inside the install directory). The software is not readily supported by the module system, easybuild. There are some ways to possibly working around this, but for most use cases, to ensure compatibility it is recommended to just compile from source. I can take a crack at installing it as a custom module though. Also, could you elaborate on what you mean by 'a bash file so that I don't have to install all of the modules'?

"3293526","2025-10-21 16:00:08","HPC Slurm/Software Issue: Conda environment","This appears to be an email thread between a researcher and the High-Performance Computing (HPC) team at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). The researcher is experiencing issues with their Conda environment not being applied consistently across all nodes in the HPC cluster.  Here's a summary of the issue:  * The researcher has allocated resources on the HPC cluster using `srun` and loaded the computation environment using `module load` commands. * They then activate the Conda environment using `conda activate`. * However, when they test the environment with `mpirun python -c 'import fiona; print(fiona.__version__)'`, only one node can use the Fiona library, while the others return a `ModuleNotFoundError`. * Further testing reveals that only one node uses the Conda environment's Python interpreter, while the others default to the system Python.  The HPC team responds with questions and suggestions:  * Max Breitmeyer asks if the issue is related to how the environment is initialized across nodes in the current cluster setup. * He also mentions that there may be a problem with the storage migration and suggests checking the `module load` commands.  To resolve this issue, the researcher could try the following:  1. Check the `module load` commands to ensure they are correct and consistent across all nodes. 2. Verify that the Conda environment is properly activated on each node by running `conda info --envs` or `conda list`. 3. Test the environment using a different method, such as running a Python script that imports the Fiona library. 4. If the issue persists, contact the HPC team for further assistance.  If you are experiencing similar issues with your Conda environment on an HPC cluster, I recommend trying these troubleshooting steps and reaching out to your cluster's support team if needed."

"3304703","2025-10-31 14:44:35","HPC Other Issue: Request for sample SLURM job script to run WRF on [SYSTEM]","Hi [USER], First off, I wanted to clarify a couple points. 1. 'I was advised that running ./wrf.exe interactively is not permitted': This is untrue. You are able to run interactive jobs, where you create a slurm allocation on a node, then connect to it and run your code directly. You are not permitted to run jobs on the login node, which I believe is what you are thinking of. If you would like some documentation on how to run an interactive job, I'll include a link to a page with the commands required to do that. How to run interactive job: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CYCbQw 2. There is also a WRF module available to be loaded on chip. You can load WRF with: 'module load WRF/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar'. WPS is also available, and can be loaded with: 'module load WPS/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar'. These installations should work, however it is a slightly older version (4.4), whereas you compiled a newer one (4.5). 3. For your locally installed and compiled copy of WRF, if you desire to use it you must use the compiled binaries located under /umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/[USER]/model2/sources/WRF/main. This is where the actual WRF binaries are stored, the directory you provided was a test directory for testing the software. You will want to add this location to your PATH environment variable to utilize the binaries. It is also possible, depending on how your install was compiled, that it would need to be recompiled for MPI support. For more info, check out the Building WRF section of this page: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php We do not have any existing documentation on running WRF/WPS explicitly, however we have documentation on running MPI jobs, including some example SBATCH scripts: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCKV There is documentation on WRF's website for running WRF using mpi, take a look here: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/running_wrf.html If you have any additional questions or need clarification, please feel free to let me know. For now I will mark this as resolved.

Could you please provide (or point me to) a sample SLURM job script for a parallel WRF run on CHIP? A template with the recommended directives and module loads would be very helpful. Specifically, I'm looking for guidance on: For context (in case it helps tailor the template): Executable(s): real.exe and wrf.exe (WRF-ARW) Input: single domain (d01) for a short 48-hour case; netCDF met_em and boundary files are ready Code location: /umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/[USER]/model2/sources/WRF/test/em_real/ I can rebuild with the cluster's preferred MPI stack if needed.
