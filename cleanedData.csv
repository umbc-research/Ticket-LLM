The approach combines historical stock price features with sentiment analysis of financial news to capture both market trends and investor sentiment. Historical price data are collected from Yahoo Finance, while relevant news articles and headlines are sourced from the News API or GDELT. Sentiment scores are derived using FinBERT, a transformer-based model optimized for financial text, and aggregated on a daily basis. These sentiment features are then merged with technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and multi-day returns. The resulting multimodal dataset is labeled according to future price direction and used to train classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices to compare the predictive power of price-only, sentiment-only, and combined feature sets. The study explores both early and late fusion approaches to integrate modalities and applies feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP) to interpret model behavior. The findings aim to demonstrate how combining quantitative and qualitative signals can improve stock trend forecasting and provide insights into the interplay between market sentiment and price dynamics.

Yet current computer-vision tools often miss the subtle, ethologically relevant kinematic motifs that report changes in internal state. In this project, we will build a neuroscience-focused computational pipeline that couples the broad foundation model with the efficient and specialized detector to identify the animal behavior responded to sensory signal inputs. Specifically, we will distill knowledge from Vision Transformers into customized single-state Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pretrain these networks on a large, unlabeled corpus of murine behavioral videos spanning diverse common behavior experimental assays. The resulting models will be fine-tuned for high-throughput quantification of classified behavior phenotypes/signatures that serve as proxies for cognitive and affective states.  This pipeline will enable experimenters to (i) stratify behavior with ethological precision, (ii) align these phenotypes with neural activities or perturbations by endogenous and environmental factors, and (iii) standardize assays across labs for reproducible neuroscience. Training and optimization demand large-scale data parallelism and extensive hyperparameter searches; thus, access to the UMBC HPC cluster is indispensable. This work will yield a biologically grounded, scalable toolset for objective behavior measurement in animal models, such as mice. The PI of this project is [USER], a Professor at Department of Biological Sciences ([EMAIL]). We would like to setup a new group to use HPC and data storage space.  Our lab recently published an analysis pipeline for animal behavior and benchmark comparison with other available tools (IntegraPose: A unified framework for simultaneous pose estimation and behavior classification.  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.10.020).  We need to scale up the model by training with a larger set of image data using the HPC.  Our project members include UMBC students who are familiar with script coding."

'I was advised that running ./wrf.exe interactively is not permitted': This is untrue. You are able to run interactive jobs, where you create a slurm allocation on a node, then connect to it and run your code directly. You are not permitted to run jobs on the login node, which I believe is what you are thinking of. If you would like some documentation on how to run an interactive job, ill include a link to a page with the commands required to do that. How to run interactive job: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CYCbQw 2. There is also a WRF module available to be loaded on chip. You can load WRF with: 'module load WRF/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar'. WPS is also available, and can be loaded with: 'module load WPS/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar'. These installations should work, however it is a slightly older version (4.4), whereas you compiled a newer one (4.5). 3. For your locally installed and compiled copy of WRF, if you desire to use it you must use the compiled binaries located under /umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/[CAMPUS ID]/model2/sources/WRF/main. This is where the actual WRF binaries are stored, the directory you provided was a test directory for testing the software. You will want to add this location to your PATH environment variable to utilize the binaries. It is also possible, depending on how your install was compiled, that it would need to be recompiled for MPI support. For more info, check out the Building WRF section of this page: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php We do not have any existing documentation on running WRF/WPS explicitly, however we have documentation on running MPI jobs, including some example SBATCH scripts: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCKV There is documentation on WRF's website for running WRF using mpi, take a look here: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/running_wrf.html If you have any additional questions or need clarification, please feel free to let me know.

I installed RSEM/1.3.3-foss-2022a, and Bowtie2/2.4.5-GCC-11.3.0. These can be loaded with 'module load RSEM/1.3.3-foss-2022a' (note, RSEM depends on BOWTIE2, so the correct version of BOWTIE2 is loaded when you load RSEM). If you encounter any issues using the modules, or need any additional modules, feel free to submit a new ticket!

This date was scheduled with your PI in advance, and during the time of migration we request that all users in the group do not use chip to avoid disturbing your groups migration. Your PI should have more information regarding the specifics. However, since pi_zzbatmos has a very large research volume, the migration is taking a long time (it was started on Friday, and is still going). After the migration properly completes, you should have access to your data. Something that you already noticed, the new Ceph research volumes start with 'pi_'. For example, the old volume was mounted at '/umbc/rs/zzbatmos', where the new volume (the one you noticed) is located at '/umbc/rs/pi_zzbatmos'. Your PI should let the group know when the migration is finished. But if you have any additional questions in the meantime, feel free to let us know! Have a good day! First Name: [USER] Last Name: [USER] Email: [EMAIL] Campus ID: [ID] Request Type: High Performance Cluster Hi, I hope this email finds you well. I noticed that my data from 'umbc/rs/zzbatmos/users/[USER]' is missing. I found that there is another directory 'umbc/rs/pi_zzbatmos/users/[USER]' in a similar path but this new directory contains partial data. Could you please let me know what happened to my original data or if it was moved somewhere else? thank you."

If you could give me the exact path to the jobs you were trying to cancel, I could test some things myself. Without more information, I can't test much myself. However, looking at the history of your 'scancel' commands, I do notice a mistake you made, which could very well be the reason it didn't work. You ran: scancel -u [USER] This is not correct on the Chip cluster; the correct command would've been: scancel --cluster=chip-cpu -u [USER] or scancel --cluster=chip-gpu -u [USER] Yes, I know it's a bit confusing, but you have to specify the cluster CPU/GPU to cancel all jobs for your user. Here's some wiki documentation about that: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1335951387/Basic+Slurm+Commands#Managing-and-Controlling-Jobs Let me know if that was the issue.

While generative AI promises assistance, most systems assume high digital literacy and overlook community infrastructures that shape adoption. We report on the community-centered design and deployment of BizChat, an LLM-powered tool for business plan development, introduced across four workshops at a feminist busi-ness incubator and makerspace. BizChat was designed to center entrepreneurs’ knowledge and workflows while providing just-in-time micro-learning and low-floor-high-ceiling accessibility. Through system log data (N=30) and semi-structured interviews (N=10) with entrepreneurs, we show how the design and deploy-ment of BizChat with existing community contexts lowered bar-riers to accessing capital, encouraged reflection, and empowered entrepreneurs to support AI-literacy within their own communities. We contribute insights into how AI tools can be deployed within local support networks, and implications for design that strengthen community resilience amid rapid technological change.
