Lab Project Title: Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction Project Abstract: This project, Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction Using Historical Prices, News, and Sentiment, aims to predict short-term stock movements up, down, or stable by integrating numerical and textual financial data. The approach combines historical stock price features with sentiment analysis of financial news to capture both market trends and investor sentiment. Historical price data are collected from Yahoo Finance, while relevant news articles and headlines are sourced from the News API or GDELT. Sentiment scores are derived using FinBERT, a transformer-based model optimized for financial text, and aggregated on a daily basis. These sentiment features are then merged with technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and multi-day returns. The resulting multimodal dataset is labeled according to future price direction and used to train classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices to compare the predictive power of price-only, sentiment-only, and combined feature sets. The study explores both early and late fusion approaches to integrate modalities and applies feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP) to interpret model behavior. The findings aim to demonstrate how combining quantitative and qualitative signals can improve stock trend forecasting and provide insights into the interplay between market sentiment and price dynamics.

For questions that you can't find a page for, feel free to submit a ticket and ask one of us directly; we'll answer it and probably add a new page to the wiki for future similar questions.  Wiki Link: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1082589207/UMBC+HPCF+-+chip Link to submit a ticket: https://rtforms.umbc.edu/rt_authenticated/doit/DoIT-support.php?auto=Research%20Computing  1. Here's a link to the general storage wiki page, and a page on how to upload data to the cluster:  General Storage wiki page: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1072267344/Storage How to upload data to the cluster: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1576534018/Uploading+Data+to+the+Cluster  Note about the 'How to upload data to the cluster', it's very beginner-friendly, so it currently only includes simple scp uploading; there are, of course, other ways to upload data to the cluster.  2. Here's a link to the wiki page on X11 forwarding and GUI applications:  https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1202749443/Accessing+GUI+Applications+on+Chip+Using+X11+Forwarding  3. We should have pages for all those general questions on the wiki, but a great place for users to start is on our 'Tutorials' wiki page, and specifically 'Getting Started on Chip':  Tutorials wiki page: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1239908360/Tutorials Getting started on chip: https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/faq/pages/1112506439/Getting+Started+on+chip  Let me know if you have any more questions!  Best, [STAFF]  Original Request:  Requestors: [STAFF] From [USER]: 'We would like to set up data transfer to storage and processing using Chip.  Can you please share some instructions or links on the following topics - 1. Storage access for the students - Emily would upload data to USDA storage that we purchased and Nadeem will store data on the storage allotted to me as PI. 2. Server access for MATLAB processing - We would do ssh login to the server and storage both, for server SSH with X11 forwarding such that matlab GUI opens up. Also do we need to mount the storage in the server machine to access data or is it automatically connected? 3. Some instructions on general things like - ssh access, mounting server, accessing storage from server for processing, checking the directory structure, file size, file moving using rsync etc. - standard things (students will also Google, but if there is any standard documentation on DOIT end, we will appreciate that).

Can you please clarify a few points so we can better diagnose the issue?  • Are the slowdowns happening only inside <strong>Emacs</strong>, or do you also see delays when running <strong>other commands</strong> (e.g., <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code>, or editing with <code>vi</code> or <code>nano</code>)?  • Are you currently working in an <strong>interactive session</strong> or through a <strong>regular SSH login</strong>?  • When you say you can’t save files, do you get a specific error message in Emacs or in the terminal?  Could you please check whether you have any large or temporary files that could be cleaned up or moved to <code>/scratch</code> instead? You can use the command below to list directory sizes:  <code>du -h --max-depth=1 /umbc/xfs2/strow/asl/s1/sergio/home/git | sort -h</code>  This will help us see if large files in your directories are contributing to the issue.

Can you please clarify a few points so we can better diagnose the issue?   Are the slowdowns happening only inside Emacs, or do you also see delays when running other commands (e.g., ls, cat, or editing with vi or nano)?   Are you currently working in an interactive session or through a regular SSH login?   When you say you can’t save files, do you get a specific error message in Emacs or in the terminal?   Could you please check whether you have any large or temporary files that could be cleaned up or moved to /scratch instead? You can use the command below to list directory sizes:   du -h --max-depth=1 /umbc/xfs2/strow/asl/s1/[USER]/home/git | sort -h   This will help us see if large files in your directories are contributing to the issue.

Ticket <URL: https://rt.umbc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?id=3301564> Last Update From Ticket: Hi [USER], Thanks for reaching out. Can you please clarify a few points so we can better diagnose the issue? Are the slowdowns happening only inside Emacs, or do you also see delays when running other commands (e.g., ls, cat, or editing with vi or nano)? Are you currently working in an interactive session or through a regular SSH login? When you say you can't save files, do you get a specific error message in Emacs or in the terminal? Could you please check whether you have any large or temporary files that could be cleaned up or moved to/scratch instead? You can use the command below to list directory sizes: du -h --max-depth=1 /umbc/xfs2/strow/asl/s1/[USER]/home/git | sort -h This will help us see if large files in your directories are contributing to the issue. Once you confirm the points above, we'll determine if it's a general filesystem performance issue or specific to your environment.

"3304703","HPC Other Issue: Request for sample SLURM job script to run WRF on CHIP","Here is the cleaned text:  I'm a graduate student working on the WRF model on the UMBC CHIP cluster. I was advised that running ./wrf.exe interactively is not permitted and that I should submit the run via SLURM because of the job's size and runtime. Could you please provide (or point me to) a sample SLURM job script for a parallel WRF run on CHIP? A template with the recommended directives and module loads would be very helpful. Specifically, I'm looking for guidance on: Executable(s): real.exe and wrf.exe (WRF-ARW) Input: single domain (d01) for a short 48-hour case; netCDF met_em and boundary files are ready Code location: /umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/[USER]/model2/sources/WRF/test/em_real/ I can rebuild with the cluster's preferred MPI stack if needed. If there's existing documentation or example scripts for CHIP users running WRF (or other large MPI jobs), a link would be great. Thank you very much for your help! | <p>Hi [USER],</p> <p>First off, I wanted to clarify a couple points.&nbsp;</p> <p>1. &quot;I was advised that running ./wrf.exe interactively is not permitted&quot;: This is untrue. You are able to run interactive jobs, where you create a slurm allocation on a node, then connect to it and run your code directly. You are not permitted to run jobs on the&nbsp;<strong>login node,&nbsp;</strong>which I believe is what you are thinking of. If you would like some documentation on how to run an interactive job, ill include a link to a page with the commands required to do that.&nbsp;</p> <p>How to run interactive job:&nbsp;https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CYCbQw</p> <p>2. There is also a WRF module available to be loaded on chip. You can load WRF with: &#39;module load WRF/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar&#39;. WPS is also available, and can be loaded with: &#39;module load&nbsp;WPS/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar&#39;. These installations should work, however it is a slightly older version (4.4), whereas you compiled a newer one (4.5).</p> <p>3. For your locally installed and compiled copy of WRF, if you desire to use it you must use the compiled binaries located under&nbsp;/umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/[USER]/model2/sources/WRF/main. This is where the actual WRF binaries are stored, the directory you provided was a test directory for testing the software. You will want to add this location to your PATH environment variable to utilize the binaries. It is also possible, depending on how your install was compiled, that it would need to be recompiled for MPI support. For more info, check out the Building WRF section of this page:&nbsp;https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php</p> <p>We do not have any existing documentation on running WRF/WPS explicitly, however we have documentation on running MPI jobs, including some example SBATCH scripts:&nbsp;https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCKV</p> <p>There is documentation on WRF&#39;s website for running WRF using mpi, take a look here:&nbsp;https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/running_wrf.html</p> <p>If you have any additional questions or need clarification, please feel free to let me know.

This date was scheduled with your PI in advance, and during the time of migration we request that all users in the group do not use chip to avoid disturbing your groups migration.</p>  <p>Your PI should have more information regarding the specifics.
