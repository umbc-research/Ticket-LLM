Lab<br /> Project Title: Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction<br /> Project Abstract: This project, Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction Using Historical Prices, News, and Sentiment, aims to predict short-term stock movements up, down, or stable by integrating numerical and textual financial data. The approach combines historical stock price features with sentiment analysis of financial news to capture both market trends and investor sentiment. Historical price data are collected from Yahoo Finance, while relevant news articles and headlines are sourced from the News API or GDELT. Sentiment scores are derived using FinBERT, a transformer-based model optimized for financial text, and aggregated on a daily basis. These sentiment features are then merged with technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and multi-day returns. The resulting multimodal dataset is labeled according to future price direction and used to train classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices to compare the predictive power of price-only, sentiment-only, and combined feature sets. The study explores both early and late fusion approaches to integrate modalities and applies feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP) to interpret model behavior. The findings aim to demonstrate how combining quantitative and qualitative signals can improve stock trend forecasting and provide insights into the interplay between market sentiment and price dynamics.<br /> <br /> N/A<br /> <br /> Attachment 1: Project Guide_ Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction.pdf</blockquote> </div> "

Also do we need to mount the storage in the server machine to access da= ta<br> or is it automatically connected?<br> <br> 3. Some instructions on general things like - ssh access, mounting server,<= br> accessing storage from server for processing, checking the directory struct= ure,<br> file size, file moving using rsync etc. - standard things (students will al= so<br> Google, but if there is any standard documentation on DOIT end, we will<br> appreciate that).<br> <br> Thank you,<br> <br> Sayantan&quot;<br> <br> --<br> <br> Best,<br> Max Breitmeyer<br> DOIT HPC System Administrator<br> <br> <br> </blockquote></div> "

We report on the community-centered design and deployment of BizChat, an LLM-powered tool for business plan development, introduced across four workshops at a feminist busi- ness incubator and makerspace. BizChat was designed to center entrepreneurs&rsquo; knowledge and workflows while providing just-in-time micro-learning and low-floor-high-ceiling accessibility. Through system log data (N=30) and semi-structured interviews (N=10) with entrepreneurs, we show how the design and deploy- ment of BizChat with existing community contexts lowered bar- riers to accessing capital, encouraged reflection, and empowered entrepreneurs to support AI-literacy within their own communities. We contribute insights into how AI tools can be deployed within local support networks, and implications for design that strengthen community resilience amid rapid technological change.

Yet current computer-vision tools often miss the subtle, ethologically relevant kinematic motifs that report changes in internal state. In this project, we will build a neuroscience-focused computational pipeline that couples the broad foundation model with the efficient and specialized detector to identify the animal behavior responded to sensory signal inputs. Specifically, we will distill knowledge from Vision Transformers into customized single-state Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pretrain these networks on a large, unlabeled corpus of murine behavioral videos spanning diverse common behavior experimental assays. The resulting models will be fine-tuned for high-throughput quantification of classified behavior phenotypes/signatures that serve as proxies for cognitive and affective states.  This pipeline will enable experimenters to (i) stratify behavior with ethological precision, (ii) align these phenotypes with neural activities or perturbations by endogenous and environmental factors, and (iii) standardize assays across labs for reproducible neuroscience. Training and optimization demand large-scale data parallelism and extensive hyperparameter searches; thus, access to the UMBC HPC cluster is indispensable. This work will yield a biologically grounded, scalable toolset for objective behavior measurement in animal models, such as mice.     The PI of this project is Dr. Weihong Lin, a Professor at Department of Biological Sciences (weihong@umbc.edu). We would like to setup a new group to use HPC and data storage space.

You are able to run interactive jobs, where you create a slurm allocation on a node, then connect to it and run your code directly. You are not permitted to run jobs on the&nbsp;<strong>login node,&nbsp;</strong>which I believe is what you are thinking of. If you would like some documentation on how to run an interactive job, ill include a link to a page with the commands required to do that.&nbsp;</p>  <p>How to run interactive job:&nbsp;https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CYCbQw</p>  <p>2. There is also a WRF module available to be loaded on chip. You can load WRF with: &#39;module load WRF/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar&#39;. WPS is also available, and can be loaded with: &#39;module load&nbsp;WPS/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar&#39;. These installations should work, however it is a slightly older version (4.4), whereas you compiled a newer one (4.5).</p>  <p>3. For your locally installed and compiled copy of WRF, if you desire to use it you must use the compiled binaries located under&nbsp;/umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/md43972/model2/sources/WRF/main. This is where the actual WRF binaries are stored, the directory you provided was a test directory for testing the software. You will want to add this location to your PATH environment variable to utilize the binaries. It is also possible, depending on how your install was compiled, that it would need to be recompiled for MPI support. For more info, check out the Building WRF section of this page:&nbsp;https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php</p>  <p>We do not have any existing documentation on running WRF/WPS explicitly, however we have documentation on running MPI jobs, including some example SBATCH scripts:&nbsp;https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCKV</p>  <p>There is documentation on WRF&#39;s website for running WRF using mpi, take a look here:&nbsp;https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/running_wrf.html</p>  <p>If you have any additional questions or need clarification, please feel free to let me know. For now I will mark this as resolved. Have a good day!</p>  <p>--&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kind regards,<br /> Danielle Esposito (she/her/hers)<br /> DoIT Unix Infra Student Worker</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <div>On Fri Oct 31 05:37:55 2025, ZZ99999 wrote: <blockquote> <pre> First Name:                Nathaniel Last Name:                 Nwoke Email:                     md43972@umbc.edu Campus ID:                 MD43972  Request Type:              High Performance Cluster  Hi HPC Team,  I&rsquo;m a graduate student working on the WRF model on the UMBC CHIP cluster.

While generative AI promises assistance, most systems assume high digital literacy and overlook community infrastructures that shape adoption. We report on the community-centered design and deployment of BizChat, an LLM-powered tool for business plan development, introduced across four workshops at a feminist busi- ness incubator and makerspace. BizChat was designed to center entrepreneurs&rsquo; knowledge and workflows while providing just-in-time micro-learning and low-floor-high-ceiling accessibility. Through system log data (N=30) and semi-structured interviews (N=10) with entrepreneurs, we show how the design and deploy- ment of BizChat with existing community contexts lowered bar- riers to accessing capital, encouraged reflection, and empowered entrepreneurs to support AI-literacy within their own communities. We contribute insights into how AI tools can be deployed within local support networks, and implications for design that strengthen community resilience amid rapid technological change.
