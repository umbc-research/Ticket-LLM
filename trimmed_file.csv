Your group is using 0 GB of a 488.3 GB quota on the old storage server.<br /> <br /> To perform these migrations, we need to take individual storage volumes offline while we migrate them to the Ceph cluster. Thus we are reaching out to schedule a date where we can migrate your volume located at &ldquo;/umbc/rs/riaduli&rdquo;. During the migration, we will take your volume offline and will terminate any jobs running on the chip compute cluster that are accessing this volume.<br /> <br /> Below we&rsquo;ve listed two options for handling this data migration - please let us know which of these you&rsquo;d prefer.<br /> <br /> Option 1: Schedule a group-wide downtime date during standard business hours, which can be done by responding to this email with your preferred date(s) to perform the migration. During this time, DoIT staff will work to migrate your volume to the Ceph storage cluster. DoIT staff will send an email alert on this email thread when the migration has begun and when it has completed. For most storage volumes, this process should take less than a business day.<br /> Option 2: If you don&rsquo;t respond to this email by October 15th, DoIT staff will assign a day over the following month (October 16th through November 15th) to migrate your volume. The day chosen will be random and will occur during business hours. You will be notified of the date chosen to perform the migration, and will be notified when the migration begins and completes.<br /> <br /> Note: After this process has completed, the new storage volume will have a new name. For example, group &ldquo;pi_doit&rdquo; will find its data under &ldquo;/umbc/rs/pi_doit&rdquo;, or in your group&rsquo;s case you will find your volume under &ldquo;/umbc/rs/pi_riaduli&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> Thank you,<br /> Elliot</p> "

Your group is using 502.9 GB of a 488.3 GB quota on the old storage server.<br /> <br /> To perform these migrations, we need to take individual storage volumes offline while we migrate them to the Ceph cluster. Thus we are reaching out to schedule a date where we can migrate your volume located at &ldquo;/umbc/rs/zmclaren&rdquo;. During the migration, we will take your volume offline and will terminate any jobs running on the chip compute cluster that are accessing this volume.<br /> <br /> Below we&rsquo;ve listed two options for handling this data migration - please let us know which of these you&rsquo;d prefer.<br /> <br /> Option 1: Schedule a group-wide downtime date during standard business hours, which can be done by responding to this email with your preferred date(s) to perform the migration. During this time, DoIT staff will work to migrate your volume to the Ceph storage cluster. DoIT staff will send an email alert on this email thread when the migration has begun and when it has completed.

We will use techniques from Human-Robot Interaction, NLP, Explainable AI, and Qualitative Methods in Cognitive Science to design control protocols and red-team a guardrail + explanation system.  Relevance to Alignment Project Objectives  Our objective is to create, test, and red-team a LLM-based conversation control system that characterizes and predicts when dialogue is on a trajectory toward a problematic user request, and intervenes early with justified, culturally-aware conversational redirection, rather than waiting for a problematic trigger to shut the request down with boilerplate refusal. Our project fits with The Alignment Project=E2=80=99s goal of desi= gning AI systems that do not attempt risky actions in the first place, in the Empirical Investigations Into AI Monitoring and Red Teaming Research Agenda, situated in the domain Human-Robot Interaction domain, as embodied interactions are increasingly employing LLMs and multi-turn conversations [1].

This study will couple big data from hydrodynamic models to evaluate the monitoring strategies that incorporate novel continuous in-situ monitoring technologies.

TITLE: Leveraging HPC Resources to Accelerate LiDAR and Remote Sensing Workflows  ABSTRACT: This project will leverage high-performance computing (HPC) resources to de= sign and scale advanced workflows for processing large LiDAR and remote sen= sing datasets. The allocation will support experiments in both multi-core p= arallelization and GPU acceleration to improve the efficiency of computatio= nally intensive tasks such as point-cloud classification, canopy-height mod= el generation, raster mosaicking, and large-area geospatial analysis. By in= tegrating open-source tools within an HPC environment at UMBC, the project = will develop reproducible, high-throughput pipelines optimized for hybrid C= PU=E2=80=93GPU architectures. These workflows will provide a foundation for=  scalable environmental research applications, demonstrating how HPC resour= ces can substantially expand the speed, scope, and analytical capability of=  modern remote sensing workflows.

This project applies advanced machine learning approaches to anal= yze large-scale maize gene and protein sequence data, aiming to uncover nov= el structural and functional insights encoded within DNA. We propose to dev= elop and implement a DNA language model trained on maize genomic sequences = to learn biologically meaningful representations that capture the intrinsic=  syntax and semantics of DNA. These learned embeddings will be integrated w= ith our custom k-mer distance=E2=80=93based model and deep neural architect= ures to predict tertiary structural and physicochemical features directly f= rom gene and protein sequences.  The large-scale data processing, model training, and structural mapping tas= ks require access to GPU-enabled high-performance computing (HPC) resources=  with distributed processing capabilities. This project is conducted in col= laboration with the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB), USDA-A= RS, Corn Insects and Crop Genetics Research Unit, Iowa State University, Am= es, IA, leveraging their extensive maize genomic and proteomic datasets. Ex= pected outcomes include (1) novel computational methods for extracting stru= ctural features from biological sequences, (2) deeper understanding of gene= -to-structure relationships in maize, and (3) new machine learning tools to=  support functional genomics and crop improvement research within the Maize= GDB community.

Your group is using 36.2 GB of a 97.7 GB quota on the old storage server.<br /> <br /> To perform these migrations, we need to take individual storage volumes offline while we migrate them to the Ceph cluster. Thus we are reaching out to schedule a date where we can migrate your volume located at &ldquo;/umbc/rs/zweck&rdquo;. During the migration, we will take your volume offline and will terminate any jobs running on the chip compute cluster that are accessing this volume.<br /> <br /> Below we&rsquo;ve listed two options for handling this data migration - please let us know which of these you&rsquo;d prefer.<br /> <br /> Option 1: Schedule a group-wide downtime date during standard business hours, which can be done by responding to this email with your preferred date(s) to perform the migration. During this time, DoIT staff will work to migrate your volume to the Ceph storage cluster. DoIT staff will send an email alert on this email thread when the migration has begun and when it has completed. For most storage volumes, this process should take less than a business day.<br /> Option 2: If you don&rsquo;t respond to this email by October 15th, DoIT staff will assign a day over the following month (October 16th through November 15th) to migrate your volume. The day chosen will be random and will occur during business hours. You will be notified of the date chosen to perform the migration, and will be notified when the migration begins and completes.<br /> <br /> Note: After this process has completed, the new storage volume will have a new name. For example, group &ldquo;pi_doit&rdquo; will find its data under &ldquo;/umbc/rs/pi_doit&rdquo;, or in your group&rsquo;s case you will find your volume under &ldquo;/umbc/rs/pi_zweck&rdquo;.<br /> <br /> Thank you,<br /> Elliot</p> "

Your group is using 36.2 GB of a 97.7 = GB quota on the old storage server.  To perform these migrations, we need to take individual storage volumes off= line while we migrate them to the Ceph cluster. Thus we are reaching out to sche= dule a date where we can migrate your volume located at =E2=80=9C/umbc/rs/zweck= =E2=80=9D. During the migration, we will take your volume offline and will terminate any jobs run= ning on the chip compute cluster that are accessing this volume.  Below we=E2=80=99ve listed two options for handling this data migration - p= lease let us know which of these you=E2=80=99d prefer.  Option 1: Schedule a group-wide downtime date during standard business hour= s, which can be done by responding to this email with your preferred date(s) to perform the migration. During this time, DoIT staff will work to migrate yo= ur volume to the Ceph storage cluster. DoIT staff will send an email alert on = this email thread when the migration has begun and when it has completed. For mo= st storage volumes, this process should take less than a business day. Option 2: If you don=E2=80=99t respond to this email by October 15th, DoIT = staff will assign a day over the following month (October 16th through November 15th) = to migrate your volume. The day chosen will be random and will occur during business hours. You will be notified of the date chosen to perform the migration, and will be notified when the migration begins and completes.  Note: After this process has completed, the new storage volume will have a = new name. For example, group =E2=80=9Cpi_doit=E2=80=9D will find its data under=  =E2=80=9C/umbc/rs/pi_doit=E2=80=9D, or in your group=E2=80=99s case you will find your volume under =E2=80=9C/u= mbc/rs/pi_zweck=E2=80=9D.

In what appears to be a tiny issue. However, this is actually indicative of problematic issues -- that I had been trying to identify since January. I had to take a serious break, since I find the observations disturbing. Let me explain slowly where to find what. Do not continue unless you have a little time to focus.  I found code from 2022 that I can demonstrate -- even now! -- to work better. The directory is  /umbc/rs/pi_gobbert/users/gobbert/teaching/math627/homework/hw2_trap/240912= _Fall2024/ver1.0solution  Here, you will see the code and executable trap that was compiled in 2022; this is HW 2 early in the semester of Math 447/627, so it is compiled just by mpiicc without any options (like -O3). This ./trap here is from 2022, as you can see from the date stamp. I have now created two slurm scripts that use chip and current options for --account, --cluster, --partition, --qos, etc. One is for 2024 chip and one for 2018 chip. If you use ""ls -ltr"" you can see the time stamps of the output files. The last line of the stdout lists observed wall clock time in seconds. This code compiled in 2022 runs faster on the 2018 hardware than the 2024 hardware, by 0.36 seconds compared to 0.64 seconds! These are similar to the numbers that I mentioned in my original ticket.  I have now created the directory  /umbc/rs/pi_gobbert/users/gobbert/teaching/math627/homework/hw2_trap/250916= _Fall2025/ver1.0solution_2022  I copied over the trap.c code from the previous directory, and I addressed some ANSI-C standard issues like return type of main() and return at the end of main program, but otherwise identical C code. I compiled anew right now using mpiicc without any options. Then I used the same slurm scripts as in above directory. Notice I am using ""mpirun -print-rank-map"", so the stdout file identifies the node used, to remove any uncertainty, which output file was on which node, 2018 vs. 2024. Notice that the 2018 node is again faster than the 2024 node!!! Cutting through all other crap, this is just disturbing. I compiled this in an interactive session on a 2024 node, so this should not be a problem.  Maybe, the issues can be resolved by using the right options (-O3, AVX, etc.), but then we must really figure this out. It is just really problematic that a new node -- with code compiled on a new node -- performs worse than an old node. That's not what my original ticket said, but this is the disturbing problem.

The long term goal is to extend the system to be able to detect and monitor sleep disorders. By using cutting-edge signal processing and machine learning methods, the system will be capable of providing precise and non-invasive sleep pattern analysis. In order to make the system scalable and capable of real-time execution, the ultimate solution will be refined for deployment on edge devices.   I am requesting access to a GPU cluster to help experiments on contact-free, multi-modal sleep stage monitoring and sleep disorder detection. This is a project to create and train machine learning models that will be used on edge devices.   "

Chip uses a service called ""autofs"" to mount and unmount directories that aren't being actively used. This helps maintain the login nodes integrity. If you see in my screenshot below, the directory appears to be empty, but when I cd to the csee directory where your software is mounted, it is all available. Backing out of the directory and ls'ing the directory also shows that the directory is now mounted and available.

The approach combines historical stock price features with sentiment analysis of financial news to capture both market trends and investor sentiment. Historical price data are collected from Yahoo Finance, while relevant news articles and headlines are sourced from the News API or GDELT. Sentiment scores are derived using FinBERT, a transformer-based model optimized for financial text, and aggregated on a daily basis. These sentiment features are then merged with technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and multi-day returns. The resulting multimodal dataset is labeled according to future price direction and used to train classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices to compare the predictive power of price-only, sentiment-only, and combined feature sets. The study explores both early and late fusion approaches to integrate modalities and applies feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP) to interpret model behavior. The findings aim to demonstrate how combining quantitative and qualitative signals can improve stock trend forecasting and provide insights into the interplay between market sentiment and price dynamics.<br /> <br /> N/A<br /> <br /> Attachment 1: <a href=""https://umbc.box.com/s/ytqz3aly2wntqzby3e5d56xfjvackh7x"" target=""_blank"">Project Guide_ Multimodal Stock Price Direction Prediction.pdf</a><br /> "

Efficency of the compiled algorithm is paramount to successful simulation, yet algorithmic methods such as Trotterization result in suboptimal circuits. Prior work has identified machine learning techniques which effeciently improve on Trotterization by several orders of magnitude. This work advances these results by factoring noise into the compilation process, allowing for the generation of circuits which will perform optimally when executed on real, noisy quantum hardware.  Dear HPC team,  I would like to request HPC access to execute quantum simulation algorithms.

Yet current computer-vision tools often miss the subtle, ethologically relevant kinematic motifs that report changes in internal state. In this project, we will build a neuroscience-focused computational pipeline that couples the broad foundation model with the efficient and specialized detector to identify the animal behavior responded to sensory signal inputs. Specifically, we will distill knowledge from Vision Transformers into customized single-state Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pretrain these networks on a large, unlabeled corpus of murine behavioral videos spanning diverse common behavior experimental assays. The resulting models will be fine-tuned for high-throughput quantification of classified behavior phenotypes/signatures that serve as proxies for cognitive and affective states.  This pipeline will enable experimenters to (i) stratify behavior with ethological precision, (ii) align these phenotypes with neural activities or perturbations by endogenous and environmental factors, and (iii) standardize assays across labs for reproducible neuroscience. Training and optimization demand large-scale data parallelism and extensive hyperparameter searches; thus, access to the UMBC HPC cluster is indispensable. This work will yield a biologically grounded, scalable toolset for objective behavior measurement in animal models, such as mice.     The PI of this project is Dr. Weihong Lin, a Professor at Department of Biological Sciences (weihong@umbc.edu). We would like to setup a new group to use HPC and data storage space.

You are able to run interactive jobs, where you create a slurm allocation on a node, then connect to it and run your code directly. You are not permitted to run jobs on the&nbsp;<strong>login node,&nbsp;</strong>which I believe is what you are thinking of. If you would like some documentation on how to run an interactive job, ill include a link to a page with the commands required to do that.&nbsp;</p>  <p>How to run interactive job:&nbsp;https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CYCbQw</p>  <p>2. There is also a WRF module available to be loaded on chip. You can load WRF with: &#39;module load WRF/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar&#39;. WPS is also available, and can be loaded with: &#39;module load&nbsp;WPS/4.4-foss-2022a-dmpar&#39;. These installations should work, however it is a slightly older version (4.4), whereas you compiled a newer one (4.5).</p>  <p>3. For your locally installed and compiled copy of WRF, if you desire to use it you must use the compiled binaries located under&nbsp;/umbc/rs/pi_cichoku/users/md43972/model2/sources/WRF/main. This is where the actual WRF binaries are stored, the directory you provided was a test directory for testing the software. You will want to add this location to your PATH environment variable to utilize the binaries. It is also possible, depending on how your install was compiled, that it would need to be recompiled for MPI support. For more info, check out the Building WRF section of this page:&nbsp;https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php</p>  <p>We do not have any existing documentation on running WRF/WPS explicitly, however we have documentation on running MPI jobs, including some example SBATCH scripts:&nbsp;https://umbc.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQCKV</p>  <p>There is documentation on WRF&#39;s website for running WRF using mpi, take a look here:&nbsp;https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrf_users_guide/build/html/running_wrf.html</p>  <p>If you have any additional questions or need clarification, please feel free to let me know. For now I will mark this as resolved.
